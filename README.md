## Overview:  
This MSc thesis explores the phenomenon of **neutrinoless double-beta (0νββ) decay**, a rare nuclear process that, if observed, would provide crucial insights into the **Majorana nature of neutrinos, lepton number violation, and the absolute mass scale of neutrinos**.  

The study delves into both **theoretical and experimental advancements** in 0νββ decay research, emphasizing:  
- The role of neutrino mass and hierarchy  
- Nuclear matrix elements and experimental sensitivities  
- Challenges in detecting this rare decay mode  
- Future prospects with tonne-scale experiments  

## Contents:  
1. **Introduction** – Importance of neutrinos in beyond-Standard Model physics  
2. **Scientific Motivation** – Why 0νββ decay matters for fundamental physics  
3. **Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay and New Physics** – Possible mechanisms and implications  
4. **Particle Physics Aspects** – Theoretical models, mass hierarchies, and experimental constraints  
5. **Nuclear and Hadronic Physics Aspects** – Nuclear matrix element calculations and hadronization effects  
6. **Experimental Design Criteria** – Isotope selection, background suppression, and detection strategies  
7. **Experimental Challenges and Strategies** – Scaling up experiments and overcoming technological barriers  
8. **Experimental Situation** – Past and recent experimental efforts and their findings  
9. **Next Steps & Future Prospects** – Roadmap for upcoming experiments and theoretical work  
10. **Conclusion** – Summary of findings and the potential impact of future research  

## Key Takeaways:  
- The detection of 0νββ decay would confirm **lepton number violation**, which is crucial for understanding the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe.  
- Current experiments have placed **strict lower bounds** on the half-life of 0νββ decay (>10²⁵ years), pushing for more sensitive next-generation detectors.  
- The study highlights **nuclear physics challenges**, including the precise determination of nuclear matrix elements and quenching effects.  
- Future experiments aim to probe the **inverted neutrino mass hierarchy region**, requiring large-scale detectors with extremely low background noise.  

## Conclusion:  
This thesis contributes to the ongoing efforts in the search for neutrinoless double-beta decay, summarizing **recent theoretical developments and experimental progress**. With upcoming large-scale experiments, this field holds significant potential to revolutionize our understanding of **neutrinos, mass generation mechanisms, and physics beyond the Standard Model**.
